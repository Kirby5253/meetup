The East Pavilion is at the far east end of Harry Meyers Park, and it's visible from the road. Bring whoever you like as guests. There're no fees or dues. Snacks will be provided. Hope to see everyone there!</p> ",

				'<p>We will be visiting various locations, ranging from within the Dallas metroplex to about a 3-hour driving range from Rowlett, to share our enjoyment of photography. The location will vary from month to month and each photo walk could last 2-3 hours up to an all-day excursion.</p> <p>We will meet at the Rowlett DART station and carpool or caravan to the destination; if meeting in Rowlett is not convenient, you can meet up anywhere along the way or the destination itself. Most members are willing to pick others up, if necessary, and convenient to their location so please let everyone know if you will need a ride to any event and every effort will be made to accommodate you.</p> <p>The 9:00 am - 5:00 pm is a guestimate as to time involved and this time will be changed as necessary, depending on our destination. The destination information will be detailed in the comments of each monthly meetup once known.</p> <p>Please be sure to bring whatever photo equipment you will need based on our targeted shoots. Some locations require an admittance fee, and this information will be posted ahead of time. Since we will typically be out for several hours, please be sure to plan for lunch while away and make sure you have cash and/or a card to pay your way.</p> ',
